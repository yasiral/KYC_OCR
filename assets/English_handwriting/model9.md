Here is my handwriting sample, written at speed on plain old mead five star notebook paper.

I am writing with my new Carene Fine point. My handwriting is still very much so in progress!!

Here is a sample written in a more slow controlled manner. First in English, then in Greek

Finally, my brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is loving, whatever is of good report, if anything is excellent or if anything is praiseworthy, think about these things. Philippians 4:8 (my translation)

ΤΟ ΔΟΚΙΜΟ, ΑΔΕΦΟΛ, ΟΥΧ ΕΘΕΛ ΑΔΗΘΩ, ΟΥΧ ΣΕΜΝΑ, ΟΥΧ ΒΙΚΙΝΑ, ΟΥΧ ΑΓΩΝΑ, ΟΥΧ ΠΡΟΣΦΟΡΑ, ΟΥΧ ΕΥΦΥΜΙΑ, ΕΛ ΤΩΣ ΑΠΕΤΥ ΚΑΙ ΕΛ ΤΩΣ ΕΝΕΛΟΥΣ ΤΑΥΤΑ ΛΟΓΙΣΕΩΣ

I would greatly welcome any input. I am quite thick skinned, so feel free to be critical.

One thing of note though... I am still getting used to the nib on this pen, so I have had a few more skipping issues than I usually do. Thanks.
