Here is my handwriting sample, written at speed on plain old mead five star notebook paper.

I am writing with my new Carone Fine point. My handwriting is still very much so in progress!!

Here is a sample written in a more slow controlled manner. First in English, then in Greek

Finally, my brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is loving, whatever is of good report, if anything is excellent or if anything is praiseworthy, think about these things.  
Philippians 4:8 (my translation)

Τὸ λοιπόν, ἀδελφοί, ὅσα εἰσὶν ἀληθῆ, ὅσα σεμνά, ὅσα δίκαια, ὅσα ἁγνά, ὅσα προσφιλῆ, ὅσα εὐφήμα, εἴ τις ἄρετη καὶ εἴ τις ἐπαίνος—ταῦτα λογίζεσθε

I would greatly welcome any input. I am quite thick skinned, so feel free to be critical.

One thing of note though... I am still getting used to the nib on this pen, so I have had a few more skipping issues than I usually do. Thanks,

Matthew A. White
