# Handwriting Sample — MATH

Here is my handwriting sample, written at speed on plain old Mead Five Star notebook paper.  

I am writing with my new Careen Fine Point. My handwriting is still very much a work in progress!

### Controlled Sample
Here is a sample written in a more slow, controlled manner — first in English, then in Greek.

> Finally, my brothers, whatever is true, whatever is  
> noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever  
> is loving, whatever is of good report, if anything is  
> excellent or if anything is praiseworthy, think about  
> these things.  
>   
> *Philippians 4:8 (my translation)*

### Greek Practice
> To doctor, aider, ox, ox estor xing by, ox  
> serux, ox serux, ox ox ox, ox ox propody,  
> ox ox oxux, ex ts xpetry hax ex ts eruxor  
> taxu loyssebe

I would greatly welcome any input. I am quite thick-skinned, so feel free to be critical.  

One thing of note though — I am still getting used to the nib on this pen, so I have had a few more skipping issues than I usually do.  

Thanks,
