Magazines generate revenue primarily through sales of copies (print and digital) and through advertising. Advertising accounts for approximately one third of total revenues across the industry. It is, therefore, vitally important that the magazine and advertising content target the same audience in order that the advertising brands benefit from increased sales as a result of advertising in the magazine.

Andrew Green identifies the ways in which magazine advertising can benefit the advertisers in an article entitled 'ESSENTIALS: The Power of Magazine Advertising':

High audience engagement  
Less distraction likely from other activities  
The ability to target niche audiences  
High production values  
- Potential for placement in highly relevant editorial environment  
Non-intrusive (readers can turn the page)  
- Long shelf life

Digital magazine formats can offer, in addition to these benefits:

The potential for interactivity and personalised targeting  
- New high engagement formats such as video
